# Foundation For Public Code Jekyll Theme

A jekyll theme for the set up of quick generic static sites and for use with GitHub pages.

## Building locally

This theme is built to run predictably on GitHub pages, therefore the [`github-pages`](https://github.com/github/pages-gem) gem is required. Run `bundle install` before building with Jekyll.
